# Instantaneous Frequency
Demonstrating different interpretations and calculations of instantaneous frequency. The figures included in this package attempt to assist in one's understanding of the underlying processes. This educational tool come out of work done by Cole van Jaarsveldt, Prof. Gareth W. Peters, Prof. Mike Chantler, and Dr Matthew Ames. This package is free for all to use and should be cited appropriately. Some of the figures included are shown below.

## Time Series

All of the analysis techniques demonstrated below used the following time series. The example time series consists of two pure harmonics also known as sinusoids which is generic term for any Sine or Cosine function. The high frequency component and the low frequency component have frequencies of 5 rad/s and 1 rad/s respectively.

## Frequency (f) versus Angular Frequency ($\omega$)

Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz) which has units of $s^{-1}$ which is per second. Angular frequency is measured in radians per second or $rad/s$ or $rad.s^{-1}$. The Diagram above demonstrates how these may be understood and used interchangeably.

## Fourier Transform

The Fourier Transform of discrete time series, $x[t]$, of length $N$ is:

$X[t] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x[n]e^{-i\frac{2\pi}{N}tn}, \text{ or}$

$X[t] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x[n]\Big(\text{cos}(\frac{2\pi}{N}tn) - i\text{sin}(\frac{2\pi}{N}tn)\Big)$.

In the figure below, the two frequency structures are clearly discernible, but there are also additional frequency structures present. These additional structures are referred to as "ghost frequencies" because there are no actual structures present at those frequencies, but the Fourier transform produces the figure below when it is performed on a time series with a non-integer number of wavelengths. This will be discussed further in the next section.

The heatmap below is another way of plotting the above figure. It is not necessary here as there is only frequency content and no temporal (or time) content. Why this is here will  be more clear when we look at the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) in a later section.

## Ghost Frequencies

Ghost frequency or ghost frequencies are informal terms used in the time-frequency analysis communities to describe and explain frequencies present in the Fourier spectrum that are not truly present in the temporal domain. These ghost frequencies are as a result of performing the Fourier transform (in the absence of a windowing technique) on time series that do not consist of an integer number of full wavelengths of underlying structures. The proliferation of Fourier bases are as a result of the optimisation algorithm trying to replicate the incomplete wavelength structures.

![](./README_images/Time_series_truncated.png)

By truncating the time series as demonstrated above, one can resolve this issue as demonstrated below. This is, however, an ill-conceived 'solution' to the problem as potentially valuable temporal and frequency content of the time series would be discarded and lost in the analysis. There are a number of better-suited solutions which do not explicitly removed part of the time series. One such technique, called Tapering, is discussed below.

## Fourier Transform with Tapering

Many different families of windows are used in the literature. One of the most common windows used is the Hann window - often mistakenly referred to as a Hanning window which is a misnomer as a result of the other commonly used window: Hamming window. The Hann window and the Hamming window are both relatively simple members of a class of window functions called Cosine-Sum Windows. They are the simplest member of this class of functions and both be described using the following function: $ \omega(f) = a_0 + (1 - a_0)\text{cos}\bigg(\dfrac{\pi{f}}{f_N}\bigg), $ with $ f \in \bigg[-\dfrac{f_N}{2}, \dfrac{f_N}{2}\bigg] $.  When using the Hamming window one has $ a_0 = \dfrac{25}{46} $ and for the Hann window, one has $ a_0 = \dfrac{1}{2} $, from which it follows that $ \omega_{Hann}(f) = \dfrac{1}{2} + \dfrac{1}{2}\text{cos}\bigg(\dfrac{\pi{f}}{f_N}\bigg) $ and $ \omega_{Hann}(f) = 0 $ when $ f \in \bigg\{-\dfrac{f_N}{2}, \dfrac{f_N}{2}\bigg\} $. In the example in the figure below one has $ \omega(f) = 2\text{cos}\Bigg(\dfrac{\pi\big({t} - \frac{5}{2}\big)}{\frac{5}{2}}\Bigg) + 1 $ with $ t \in \bigg[0, 5\bigg]. $

In the figure below one can observe that by performing the Fourier transform on the tapered time series, the frequency content is far more clear when compared to the Fourier transform of the original time series. The tapered time series also displays far fewer ghost frequencies as a result of the tapering. This tapering does, however, lessen the amplitude of the frequency content, but this can be partially resolved by comparing the relative intensities of the significant frequencies within the frequency content.

![](./README_images/FT_tapered.png)

The below figure is another way of comparing the Fourier spectrum plots of the tapered time series and the untapered time series. There is no temporal content in either figure, but this figure will make further sense when it is compared against the Fourier spectrum plots in the Short-Time Fourier Transform and Morlet Wavelet Transform sections to follow.

### Short-Time Fourier Transform

The short-time Fourier transform is a natural extension of the tapered Fourier transform - it is able to detect a varying frequency and amplitude and it was one of the first steps towards a measure of an instantaneous frequency. This particular application of the short-time Fourier transform does not demonstrate the ability of the short-time Fourier transform to measure a varying frequency. The image below is used in conjunction with the image below that to demonstrate how the short-time Fourier transform works.

![](./README_images/STFT.png)

The image above corresponds to the plot intervals in the image below. A tapered Fourier transform is performed on the first measure interval - this estimates the instantaneous frequency at the centre of the interval which corresponds to the maximum of the Hann window. Once the Fourier transform has been performed, it is plotted in a forward-difference fashion with the frequency over an interval plot corresponding to the instantaneous frequency on the left of the interval - this is convention and not essential.

### Morlet Wavelet Transform

In this approach, the time domain is also partitioned but instead of full sinusoidal functions, Morlet Wavelet Transform (MWT)  and other related wavelet techniques use wavelet packets to investigate the frequency content of a time series - this also adds a layer of complexity in that the wavelet packets are adjustable  which allows the technique to increase the frequency resolution at lower frequencies.

![](./README_images/Morlet_wavelet_demonstration.png)

Fixed wavelet packets can be viewed in the figure below. These packets have fixed 'widths' which are independent of the frequency of the wavelet. 'Width' is used as the Gaussian functions are used which technically have infinite domains, but the functions taper off exponentially and is effective as tapering function in this instance. With fixed windows, the higher frequency structures are easier to discern using fixed windows as more wavelengths are within the significant Gaussian tapered window.
